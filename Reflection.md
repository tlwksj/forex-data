Project Reflection

**What did the data show**     
I noticed that the data does not show a lot variance day by day, having most of the changes be at most be 20 cents. In the past week, the Mexican peso appears to have strengthened as we can observe the negative slope on the past week visualization. As I have mentioned, there were no huge changes between the rates, meaning that both currencies were stable. 

**What went right**   
  I was very fortunate that both of the APIs provided the data in a very clean manner. Allowing for minimal cleaning having to be done on the second script, this also made it easier to work with in general. I would say that 90% of the scripting done with R was done without horrible issues, aside from the typical errors one has as they build a project. 

**What went wrong**   
  As much as I would love to not accept this, I have always struggled creating visualizations, so ggplot gave me a hard time trying to bring to life the ideas I had. Aside from that another issue I came upon was one of the APIs only allowing me to retrieve the exchange rate from the euro's perspective. After doing some digging for another API and being unsuccesful, I decided that this would not be a limiting factor, given that the USD/MXN rate could be easily calculated from the EU rates for both of these currencies. I think, overall, both of these issues were solved, as I found a way to patch both.

**The future**   
  One of the things I would love to implement in the future is a script that will email the day's exchange rate and a simple visualization. This would make it even more simple for many to access this data, as it would be right there, on their inbox, every morning. I currently only know how to do this in Python, but I believe it would be interesting to try and do it in R.
